# Where Da Fam At

## The Situation

Never liked Life360 for location communication. Created a system based on Trust and Emoji's to convey location status to the family. Each family memember has chosen emojis to represent them in the text message chain. 
On update to the location or traveling, the emoji representing the action gets sent in the group chat. A response of acknowledgement is sent by any of the other members. This fairly constant stream of updates floods the communication flow, and can make searching for other messages more difficult.

## The Goal

Create an app that replaces the SMS based system.
